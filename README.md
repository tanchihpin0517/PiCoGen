## What's PiCoGen?

PiCoGen (**Pi**ano **Co**ver **Gen**eration) is an
academic project aimed at developing an automatic piano cover
generation system. The system takes a music audio input and
produces its cover version of the original piece. Current
PiCoGen has two versions: PiCoGen (v1) and PiCoGen2 (v2). The
first version employs a two-stage process, extracting the lead
sheet using SheetSage and generating the piano cover based on
the extracted lead sheet. The second version explores an
end-to-end approach to avoid potential information loss from the
two-stage process, which is observed in the previous version.
Both approaches demonstrate the ability to capture intermediate
musical features and generate piano covers effectively. Please
